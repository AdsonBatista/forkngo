## Fork-n-Go

These are website project repositories on GitHub that are designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages, meaning, whenever someone forks the repsository and commits one change, they've got a live and hosted site!

If you've got a Fork-n-Go style project, [add it to the site](contributing.md). And grab a [badge](/badges) from the folder if you'd like.

** Badges for you! Badges for you! Badges for you! **
